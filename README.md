<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/c3c8tC8/editing.png' style='width: 100%;'>

I had a problem, I wanted to create a simple website that would only have a few pages and that would also reuse some components.
Simple enough right? Wrong. My project quickly grew unorganized and a pain to manage.

Thats why I created this! It lets you create websites that have reusable page templates and code snippets.
It runs very fast and dosent even require a server to work!

It was made with 100% vanilla JavaScript, so feel free to look around the src/ folder to see the backend stuff!
