		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>This blog was created for me to show off how StaticJS works and how it can improve your websites workflow.
		StaticJS is used by many people out there who want to make there websites more dynamic and managable without the fuss of Node.</p>
		<p>When I use StaticJS, I dont even feel like im writing code, I'm writing content.
		Because of the fact that SJS take care of all the backend stuff for me, I can spend my time worrying about what I actually want to do, which is writing articles.
